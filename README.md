# Dave Miles: A hike distance converter

This is Dave Rappoccio.

Great husband, good cook, talented graphic artist and outdoor enthusiast - and horrible distance estimator.

After enduring many different hikes with Dave... The worst example of this was when we hiked to Table Mountain, a hike that Dave promised would be "like 5 miles, 6 miles max."

So because he's a good sport, I built "Dave Miles" a teensy little app that will convert the amount of miles Dave has said that you're going to hike and converting it into what you're actually going to hike.
